# AngularFirst
Angular 7 app using Angular cli, vscode and windows 10

To Create a new Angular app, use angular cli and node.js Link
Open Powershell from a folder (Ctrl+Shift+RightClick)
type command : ng new AngularFirst
Next it asks for Add Angular Routing, Enter Y for yes
For Stylesheet selection, select css

It will Create a folder with Named 'AngularFirst'

Open this folder with your editor.
I am using vscode 

Open Powershell terminal from vscode. 
run command ng serve --port 4205
Above command , compile your initial code and start a port 4205 to Launch your application.
Open url http://localhost:4205/ to see your starter app with Angular 7

till time, I haven't made any changes with AngularFirst.

Angular CLI by default created folders and files to setup your initial project.
Folder: e2e:- This folder is used to test end to end testing of your app.
